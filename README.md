# FileUploadToDrive

This is a C# .net console application to demonstrate the ways to upload a file to Google Drive.
The project starts with a code to upload a single file to the drive. And then, we move to uploading muliple files.
We explore the sequential as well as parallel upload of multiple files and compare the time taken to execute the task in each way.
